The following describes the three functions implemented in my Bookstore Managment System:

1) The first function should allow the user to created a premium or non-premium account. This function relies heavily on the fields present in the Membership.java file. The fields are passed to a constructor and the user enters the information into the console to create a Membership.java object. The user is asked to enter in a balance and then if they want to maker their accont premium or not. If the user responds with yes, the program calls the deductBalance() method to withdraw $5 from the users balance and the premiumAcct field is set to true. 

2) The second function should all the user to complete a purchase of all items in their cart. The user is asked how many of the item they want and each object (Book, Movie, and Music_CD) call their respective add function in the ItemOrder.java file. The item is then added to the respective item array list which acts as the users cart. The user can then proceed to check out which asks the user for their username and password. The system calls the respective get methods for these attributes and checks to see if they match the users input. If correct, the user will be shown their payment information and their total. They can select to pay or not to pay. Once paid, the system calls the deductBalance method on the member object and the amountSpent attribute gets set equal to the amount the user paid in the purchase. 

3) The third function implemented adds a 5% "little cart" fee for purchase under $50 for non-premium users. This function checks the membership objects premiumAcct field and then checks if the cart total is less than $50. If it is the cart total is increased by 5% and the user is shown their total if they were a premium member along with their actual total.
